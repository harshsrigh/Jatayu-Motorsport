GOOGLE METHOD :
1. Creat a google form with question as variables required
2. Link the form to a spreadsheet (so that a spreadsheet of same data is created and also can be filled using form)
3. Use pushingbox website to link the form as
          - Create a Service -> Custom one -> enter url of RESPONSE page of form
          - Inspect the answer spaces of the form for each answer and get the entry id (of form entry.123456)
          - My Scenario -> Add a name -> Add an action (Select the service created) -> In token enter the format as 
   
            ?entry.1855699688=$FirstVariable$&entry.69530139=$SecondVariable$&submit=Submit   (Very Very Important)  (Get the DevID generated)

4. Follow the Syntax :
       - Set TCP connection : AT+CIPSTART="TCP","213.186.33.19",80  (no 4 because CIPMUX=0) //needs testing for CIPMUX=1
       - Send length of data : AT+CIPSEND="Length Here"
       - Important Sending Syntax : 
                      cmd =  "GET /pushingbox?devid=";
                      cmd += *your id from pusing box here*;
                      cmd += "&FirstVariable="+String(value1)+"&SecondVariable="+String(value2)+" HTTP/1.1\r\n";  (Use the same name for variables as used in token)
                      cmd += "Host: api.pushingbox.com\r\n\r\n"; 
 
Points :
    - Worked for as less as 1 second delay. (Not recommended due to very less time for AT Command execution)
    - Data already in an excel like format with similar tools                                    //Need to check for dynamic graph insertion
    - Seems to be the best alternative yet. (Only 1000 API request per day per Account)
